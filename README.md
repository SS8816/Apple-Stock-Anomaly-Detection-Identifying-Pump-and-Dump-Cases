# Apple Stock Anomaly Detection ‚Äì Identifying Pump-and-Dump Cases

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **anomaly detection in Apple (AAPL) stock prices**, specifically to identify **pump-and-dump cases** or unusual trading patterns. By leveraging **unsupervised learning techniques**, we highlight potential stock manipulations using multiple statistical and AI-based approaches.

**Disclaimer:** This is a **student project** and is not meant for real-world financial decision-making. While it demonstrates anomaly detection techniques, it does not catch all anomalies accurately based on real-world data.

## Methodology
### Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Collected **10+ years of Apple stock data** from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.
- Cleaned data, handled missing values, and converted necessary columns.
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with trend visualizations.

### Technical Indicators for Trend Analysis
- **Moving Averages**: SMA (20-day, 50-day) & EMA (20-day) to detect trends.
- **Volatility Analysis**: Calculated **daily returns** and 20-day rolling volatility.
- **Bollinger Bands**: Identified overbought/oversold conditions.

### Anomaly Detection Techniques & Why They Were Used
This project explores multiple methods to detect stock price anomalies:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Z-Score Method**: A simple statistical method that flags anomalies when data points deviate more than **3 standard deviations** from the mean. It's useful for quick detection but struggles with non-Gaussian distributions.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Isolation Forest**: A tree-based model that isolates anomalies by splitting data points in a random manner. It works well for **high-dimensional data** and is widely used in financial fraud detection.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: This method identifies anomalies based on how isolated a data point is compared to its neighbors. It is effective in **detecting local deviations**, such as sudden price spikes.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)**: Finds anomalies by looking at data density. Data points that don‚Äôt belong to any dense cluster are flagged as anomalies. This is useful for **detecting irregular trading patterns**.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Hybrid Model (IF + LOF)**: Combines **Isolation Forest and LOF** to flag anomalies detected by both methods, improving accuracy by reducing false positives.

### AI Model ‚Äì LSTM & Autoencoder for Deep Learning Anomaly Detection
To explore more advanced anomaly detection, we implemented an **LSTM Autoencoder**:

üîπ **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that captures temporal dependencies in stock prices. It helps in predicting stock price behavior over time.

üîπ **Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection**:
   - The model learns to **reconstruct stock price patterns**.
   - If the reconstruction error is **too high**, it signals an anomaly.
   - We applied **Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) and normalized thresholding** to classify anomalies.

üîπ **LSTM Code Structure:**
   - **Preprocessing:** Data is normalized using `MinMaxScaler`.
   - **Sequence Creation:** A time window of **30 days** is used to feed stock price movements into the model.
   - **LSTM Autoencoder Architecture:**
     - **Encoder:** Two LSTM layers compress data into a smaller representation.
     - **Decoder:** Two LSTM layers reconstruct the original data.
     - **Reconstruction Error:** Anomalies are flagged if the difference between actual and predicted prices is too large.
   - **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to measure reconstruction accuracy.

### Validation: Real Stock Events
- Matched detected anomalies with **historical stock events** (earnings reports, product launches, regulatory changes, market crashes).
- Used **Yahoo Finance news data** for validation.

## How to Run the Project
